Three child branches are introduced as next. Details can be referred in each individual branch:
1. [DTF Calculation](https://github.com/penggenchang/DTF-and-Seizure-Network/tree/DTF-Calculation): This branch implements the Python code for directed transfer function (DTF), a widely-applied directed connectivity metric in EEG data analysis.
2. [Graph Visualization](https://github.com/penggenchang/DTF-and-Seizure-Network/tree/Graph-Visualization): This branch includes different functions to visualize the DTF-based seizure network during analysis.
3. [Related Works](https://github.com/penggenchang/DTF-and-Seizure-Network/tree/Related-Works): This branch lists the other related references that we compare with.
