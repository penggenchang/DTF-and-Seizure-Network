# DTF-and-Seizure-Network-Modeling
This repository summarizes the basic modules for directed transfer function (DTF) and visualization functions for SEEG-based seizure network modeling and analysis. 

**This research involved human subjects, and was under approval on experimental procedures and protocols, which were granted by the Institutional
Review Boards (IRB) of The University of Texas at Dallas (UT Dallas) and University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), under No. IRB-21-198.**

**Any inquiry of clinical data and subjects' information is upon reasonbale request, and shall contact the corresponding PI of this research:

Each branch is introduced as next. Details can be referred in each individual module:
1. DTF Calculation: This branch implements the directed transfer function (DTF), a widely-applied directed connectivity metric in EEG data analysis.
2. Connectivity Matrix: This branch is the function to visualize the connectivity matrix after DTF calculation.
3. Graph Visualization: This branch is the function to visualize the DTF-based seizure network from the connectivity matrix.
4. Related Works: This branch lists the related references. Please carefully consider refer to those.
