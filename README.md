**This branch includes the Python implementation of directed transfer function (DTF). Major library includes: Numpy, Panda and Statsmodel**. 

DTF is a frequency-domain directed (effective) connectivity metric for brain signal analysis and functional network modeling. To enhance the statistical robustness of DTF estimation, **surrogate data analysis** can be added into each windowed frame (2-second chosen in our work). Surrogate data follows the idea of bootstrap, which is to reshuffle the original data in time domain (i.e., permutation) or frequency domain (i.e., phase shuffle) multiple times and re-estimate the DTF values. Assuming the DTF correlation is spurious, i.e., generated by random factors, values of each surrogate will formalize a normal-distribution. On the other hand, if the DTF value is significant, it will fall beyond the significance threshold (i.e., $$p < 0.01$$). The following paper is suggested:
