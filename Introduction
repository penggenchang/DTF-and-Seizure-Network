This branch includes the Python implementation of directed transfer function (DTF). Major library includes: Numpy, Panda and Statsmodel. 

DTF is a frequency-domain directed (effective) connectivity metric for brain signal analysis and functional network modeling. It is based on multi variable autoregressive model (MVAR) over frequency band (e.g., 10-30Hz). introduction can be found in:

**M. Kamiński and K.J. Blinowska, "A new method of the description of the information flow in the brain structures", Biol. Cybern. 65, 1991, pp 203-210.**

pp 195–207.**

For illustration purpose, there are 20 signal channels (i.e., SEEG contact points), the model order K is chosen 10, and frequency band is $\beta$ [13,30]Hz.

All SEEG-related information is anonymous and deidentified due to IRB regulation.
