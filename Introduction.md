**This branch lists the general functions for DTF-based seizure network visualization and statistical analysis. Three functions are applied for graph visualization:**

1. Matrix visualiztion, which shows the 20 by 20 DTF matrix;
2. Graph visualization, which plots the network graph with nodes and edges;
3. Density comparison, which plots the boxplots of network density.
